      United States and in European Union countries. Some or all of your data

      EEA”) (The EEA consists of all EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland and
      Liechtenstein). You are deemed to accept and agree to this by using Our
      Site and submitting information to Us. If We do store or transfer data
      outside the EEA, We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your
      data is treated as safely and securely as it would be within the EEA and
      under the GDPR. Such steps may include, but not be limited to, the use of
      legally binding contractual terms between Us and any third parties. 2. 
      Data security is of great importance to Us, and to protect your data We
      have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures
      to safeguard and secure data collected through Our Site. 3. 
      Notwithstanding the security measures that We take, it is important to
      remember that the transmission of data via the internet may not be
      completely secure and that you are advised to take suitable precautions
      when transmitting to Us data via the internet.
